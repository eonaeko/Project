                <p>
                    CSS is a language used to give styles to HTML documents, It handles the presentation of your webpage to users, it gives the developer a lot of power to determine how a particular HTML element is displayed to the users for example: the color of the element, it&apos;s background color, the spaces around the element to other element, it&apos;s border, the position it occupies and so on.<br>
                    There have been different versions of CSS but the current version that web developers are using is <span class="smaller-span">CSS3</span>
                </p>
                <!--Remember to change of this section to act as a disclaimer.-->
                <p>NOTE: we would be talking about the major concept of CSS and it&apos;s syntax and everything that gets you up and running with basic CSS from Applying CSS to your page, how to select elements, using of the id and class attributes, pseudo-elements, precedence,  inhertiance, CSS comments, CSS Box model but we won&apos;t really be introducing you to some other styles and not to worry, we would provide links to website that teaches them more verbose.</p>

                   <h2>Writing the rules</h2>
                   <p>A stylesheet is made up of one or more style instrutions <span class="medium-span">(called styles rules)</span> that is capable of defining how elements on the page is displayed.<br>
                Every style rules in the stylesheet basically select this element and give it the following style to alter it&apos;s look.
               In CSS, the two main sections on a rule are:<br><br>
               <span class="medium-span"> The Selector:</span>  used to identifies the element or elements to be affected.<br>
               <span class="medium-span"> The Declarations:</span> This provides the rules to be followed and displayed on the element selected. The declarations itself is made up of a property and its value which is seperated with a colon<span class="smaller-span">(:) </span>and a declaration is closed with a semi colon<span class="smaller-span">(;)</span>
               <br> <code>p{color: red;}</code><br>
               In the illustration above, this is interpreted as follows, the <span class="medium-span">p</span> is the selector which is used to selects paragraph tag in the document
               <br> Every thing in the curly brackets<span class="medium-span">{ }</span> is referred to as the declaration while the property in this example is <span class="smaller-span">color</span> and the value is <span class="smaller-span">red</span><br>

               We can have more than one declaration in those curly brackets and this time we would called a <span class="smaller-span">declaration block.</span>
            </p>
               </section>
               <section>
                   <h2>How to apply the css to the document</h2>
                   <p>There are three way to apply CSS to your webpage:<br><br>
                    <span class="medium-span">External Stylesheet:</span><br>
                      An External stylesheet is a text-only file contained our css style rules in them, this file must always go with a <span class="medium-span">.css</span> suffix and they are not permiitted to contain any HTML tags.<br><br>
                      The file can then to be used to style our HTML documents by linking it to our HTML file(using the link tag) or imported our HTML document.<br>
                      External stylesheets are most preferred and most use out of the three other methods cause one css file can be used to style as many file as possible and they seperate your HTML code from presentational (CSS) code
                   </p>
                <h3>Using the link element to link css with HTML</h3>
                <p>
                The <span class="smaller-span">link</span> element defines a relationship between the current document and other resource, the <span class="smaller-span">link</span> goes within the <span class="smaller-span">head</span> element and must contains two attributes.
                <br><br>
                <span class="medium-span">rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;</span><br>
                The<span class="smaller-span">rel</span> attribute tells the browser that the type of relationship that the linked document has with the current document and with CSS, the value of the rel attribute for css is always stylesheet<br><br>
               <span class="medium-span">href=&quot;url of css file &quot;</span><br>
               The <span class="smaller-span">href</span> attribute is provides the location to the CSS file
               <code class="no-center">
            &lt;head&gt;<br>
              <code class="txt-indent"> &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href =&quot;style.css&quot;&gt;</code>
            &lt;/head&gt;
               </code>
               This illustration above shows a css file named style.css that linked to an HTML documnet using the link element in the head element
                </p>
                <h3>Using @import to linked css with HTML</h3>
                <p>
                    You can also use the @import statement to provide the css file to HTML. if you use this method, you place your @import statement in a <span class="smaller-span">style</span> element.
                <code class="no-center">&lt;head&gt;</code>
                <code class="no-center txt-indent">&lt;style&gt;</code>
                <code class="no-center txt-indent"> @import url(&quot;style.css&quot;);</code> 
                <code class="no-center txt-indent">&lt;/style&gt;</code>
                <code class="no-center">&lt;/head&gt;</code>

                This method is not the most common but can be used if you want to import a particular screen sizes using some media queries along side with it.
                
            <br><br>
            <span class="medium-span">Embedded Stylesheet:</span><br>
            Embedded Stylesheets is used when the css styles rules are placed within the <span class="smaller-span">style</span> element in the <span class="smaller-span">head</span> but the downside of this is that it can only be on that particular document alone.
            <code class="no-center">&lt;head&gt;</code>
            <code class="no-center txt-indent">&lt;style&gt;</code>
            <code class="no-center txt-indent">style rules go here</code> 
            <code class="no-center txt-indent">&lt;/style&gt;</code>
            <code class="no-center">&lt;/head&gt;</code>

            <span class="medium-span">Inline Styles:</span><br>
            Inline styles allow you to be able to apply properties and values to a single element by using the <span class="smaller-span">style</span> attribute in the element itself
            
            <code>&lt;h1 style = "color:red"&gt; heading one &lt;/h1&gt;</code>
            To add multiple styles, seperate them with semi colons(;)
            <code>&lt;h1 style = "color:red; font-size:120%;"&gt; heading one &lt;/h1&gt;</code>
            Inline styles may come in handy if you want to override some other styles that have applied with exeternal or embedded stylesheets but Inline styles are highly problematic cause they interfere with content of the page and does should be avoided.

                   <h2>CSS Comments</h2>
                   <p>
                       CSS allows for developers to leave comments in their code, this is highly helpful if you are collaborating with someone on a project or even if you are going to come back to the code latter and sometimes you can use to test different styles by commenting and uncommenting them as needed.<br><br>
                       Content between<span class="medium-span"> /*</span> and <span class="medium-span">*/</span> will be ignored when stylesheets are parsed and you can leave  comments at anywhere in the code and they can span muitiple lines<br><br>

                       <code>/*This is a comment and I am ignored <br>
                    when stylesheets are parsed*/</code>

                   <h2>CSS Selectors</h2>
                   <p>
                       In understanding CSS, we must understand its syntax and also in understanding its syntax and using it to style our page, we most importantly need to understand what CSS selectors are and the different type of selectors there are and the ways of using them to style our page.<br>
                       CSS selectors are used to select nodes/element from the DOM and thus styling them and there are a number of selectors and let jumpin to understanding them.<br><br>
                       <span class="medium-span">Element Type selector: </span><br>
                       The element type selector are the most basic and type of selector we are. for example: if we want to select paragraphs on our page and give them a color of blue, we can use the element selector<span class="smaller-span">(p)</span> and give a color of blue to them.
                       <code>
                           p {color: blue;}
                       </code>
                       This would go into the page then look for all elements that are paragraphs and give them color of blue.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                       <span class="medium-span">Grouped Selectors:</span><br>
                       Most times, we would want to apply same style to a couple of elements on our page, we could do this more efficiently by grouping our selectors in one style rule declaration by seperating them then with a comma<span class="smaller-span">(,)</span>
                       <code>
                           h1,h2,p,img{</code>
                           <code class="txt-indent2">  margin:20px;</code>
                         <code> }</code>
                         This style rule above would apply a margin of 20px to all the element listed above <span class="smaller-span">(h1,h2,p,img)</span><br>
                         When we use grouped selectors, it would make furture possible edits more efficient and less time consuming.
                   </p>
               </section>
               <section>
                   <h2>Contextual Selectors</h2>
                   <p>In the DOM, we consists elements to be <span class="smaller-span">Parents</span> or <span class="smaller-span">Children</span> because some elements contains other elements while some elements are contained in other elements For example: The <span class="smaller-span">body</span> element can be considered as a <span class="smaller-span">parent</span> because
                    it will contain other element that form the page and we could aslo consider the <span class="smaller-span">body</span> element as a <span class="smaller-span">child</span> cause it is contained in the <span class="smaller-span">html</span> element and this gives rise to other complex relationship between element.
                   </p>
                   <h3>Descendent Selectors</h3>
                <p> Descendent Selectors targets element contained another element, Descendent selector is an example of a contextual selctors because it selects elements based on its context or relationship to another element.<br>
                    Descendent selector are indicted in a list seperated by a character space
                    <code>p em {
                        font-size:120%
                    }
                    </code>
                    This example targets emphasized text <span class="smaller-span">(em)</span> that are only contain in a paragraph <span class="smaller-span">(p)</span>, Other emphasized text contains in other element that not in the <span class="smaller-span">p</span> would not be affected.<br>
                    Descendent selectors can be grouped in a comma-seperated list and it is possible to nest descendent selectors several layers deep.
                    <code>
                        ul li a {text-decoration: none;}
                    </code>
                    This example selects  an anchor<span class="smaller-span"> a</span> tags that are contained in a list-ltems<span class="smaller-span"> li</span> and in an unordered list<span class="smaller-span"> ul</span>
                </p> 
                <h3>Child Selectors</h3>
                <p>Child selector is similar to descendent selector but child selector only selects direct children of a given element. They are indicated with a greater-than symbol<span class="smaller-span">(>)</span> and they are contextual selectors
                 <code>
                     p > em {font-size:120%;}
                 </code>
                 This example would select emphasized text that are only directly contained in a <span class="smaller-span">p</span> element.
                </p>
                <h3>Next-Sibling Selectors</h3>
                <p>
                    The next-sibling selector selects element that comes directly after another element with the same <span class="smaller-span">parent</span>. it is indicated with a plus <span class="smaller-span">(+)</span> sign 
                    <code>h2+p{font-family:serif;}</code>
                    This rule above would style paragraphs that follow an h2
                </p>
                <h3>Subsequent-sibling selectors</h3>
                <p>The subsequent-sibling selector selects element that shares same <span class="smaller-span">parent</span> with the specified element and occurs after it in the source order, they need not follow each other directly it is indicated with a <span class="smaller-span">(~)</span> sign
                <code>h1 ~ h2{font-weight:normal;}</code>
                The following rule selects any <span class="smaller-span">h2</span> that both shares a parent element (such as <span class="smaller-span">section or article</span>) with an <span class="smaller-span">h1</span> appears after it in the document.
                </p> 
               </section>
               <section>
                   <h2>ID Selectors</h2>
                   <p>
                       We can assign Id attribute to element on our page and then access them in CSS to style them. The ID attribute is unique and should only be used once on our HTML page, ID selectors allow us to target elements with their ID values. The hash or pound <span class="smaller-span">(#)</span> symbol is used to identifed an id selectors in CSS we can use ID selectors as part of contextual selector
                       <br><br>
                       HTML Mark up
                       <code class="no-center">&lt;p id=&quot;MyPara&quot;&gt;This is my first paragraphs&lt;/p&gt;</code>
                       CSS
                       <code class="no-center">#MyPara{</code>
                        <code class="no-center">color:blue;<br>
                        background-color:red<br>
                       }</code>
                       In the example above, we see how the id attribute was used in HTML markup which was later referced through its value with hash <span class="smaller-span">#</span> symbol to identify it as an ID selector and give the following style.
                   </p>
                   <h2>Class Selectors</h2>
                   <p>
                       We can group elements on our page into a conceptual group by using the class attribute and unlike ID attribute , different elements can shared same class name<br>
                       To target elements belonging to the same class we use the class selector. Class selectors are indicated with a period <span class="smaller-span">(.)</span> at the beginning of the selector.
                       <br><br>
                       HTML markup
                       <code class="no-center">&lt;p class=&quot;MyClass&quot;&gt;lovely&lt;/p&gt;</code>
                       <code class="no-center">&lt;div class=&quot;MyClass&quot;&gt;I am learning CSS&lt;/div&gt;</code>
                       CSS
                       <code class="no-center">.MyClass {font-size: 1em;}</code>
                       In the example above, different elements were grouped in a class called MyClass aand was access by CSS following the class name with a period <span class="smaller-span">(.)</span><br><br>
                       We can also be more precise about what we want to styles with CSS
                       <code>P.MyClass{color: red;}</code>
                       This would style only paragraphs with the class of  <span class="smaller-span">MyClass </span>as with this example
                       
                   </p>
                   <h2>The Universal Selector</h2>
                   <p>Sometimes we might want to use a properties that would be applied to all elements on the page for example: intialization of margin to zero, setting the box-sizing property to border-box for all elementa, We can achieve this using the universal selector <span class="smaller-span">(*)</span>indicated with the asterisk <span class="smaller-span">*</span> symbol
                 <code>*{margin: 0;}

                 </code>
                 This example above sets all elements on the page to have a margin of zero although this could be overwritten later in the page.
